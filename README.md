# lyme_chip_sklearn_analysis
Jupyter Notebooks for applying sklearn machine learning models to data produced by Cady lab's fluorescent plasmonic biochip assay
This is a collection of preliminary code exploring the application of various machine learning models to the data produced by the lyme biochip.
Most models are examined for performance in both multi classifier and binary classifier (positive vs negative) formats.
Data consists of normalized fluorescence signal relating to antibody levels in response to 12 Lyme antigens.
eda.ipynb is an exploratory data analysis notebook examining the data in various manners.
